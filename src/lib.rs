/// # Behavior
///
/// This function first creates a one-shot channel for shutdown signal communication.
/// It then spawns a new asynchronous task to start the REST server, listening on the provided port.
///
/// The function also sets up Unix signal listeners for SIGINT (Ctrl+C) and SIGTERM (termination request).
/// If either of these signals is received, a shutdown signal is sent to the server.
///
/// The function then waits for either the server task to complete, or for a shutdown signal to be received.
/// If a shutdown signal is received, it sends a message over the one-shot channel to signal the
/// rest server to shut down.
///
/// If the server task completes (either normally or due to an error), the function returns.
/// If a shutdown signal is received, the function waits for the server task to shut down before returning.
///
/// # Errors
/// If an error occurs while starting the REST server, it is converted to an `anyhow::Error` and
/// returned.
